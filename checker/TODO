Optional addons to explore.

external services

 * any23
 * Toby Inkster's perl library: perl -MCPAN -e shell 
   install RDF::RDFa::Parser
   docs http://cognition-parser.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/swignition/extras/RDF-RDFa-Parser/lib/RDF/RDFa/Parser.pm
   use RDF::RDFa::Parser;
    $parser = RDF::RDFa::Parser->new($xhtml, $baseuri);
   $parser->consume;
  $graph = $parser->graph;

API

 * Look at the draft W3C RDFa API and consider adoption
 * fix the way we expose the supplied URL (or don't, currently...)
 * APIs for reading from local file and supplied text
 * Charset?
 * Linter has a "Site URL" field, seemingly auto-derrived. 
   e.g. see http://developers.facebook.com/tools/lint/examples/meta_name
 * Agree a canonical form for testing (JSON/triples?)
 * Lite parser (from https://github.com/scottmac/opengraph) not parsing fb: properties (but then ogp.me doesn't mention them)

IMPLEMENTATIONS

 * remove the many parts of ARC library we don't need (MySQL store etc.). Or at least make dependencies clear.
 * patch the bits of ARC2 parser that cause PHP5 to emit warnings?
 * wire in other parser sources
 * Ubuntu ships an earlier phpunit which isn't happy with our setup - investigate

DOCS

Perhaps a flow chart, with HTML, OG markup, FB content, and accuracy as different ways of screwing up.

Share wiki space with other parser / toolkit folk? common testcases?

LINTING

 We want all the bad examples to be detectable, using either the simple parser or an RDFa-based on.
 Reproduce 'meta name' linter check from fb
