==OPTIONAL== 

Optional addons to explore.

external services

 * any23
 * Toby Inkster's perl library: perl -MCPAN -e shell 
   install RDF::RDFa::Parser
   docs http://cognition-parser.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/swignition/extras/RDF-RDFa-Parser/lib/RDF/RDFa/Parser.pm
   use RDF::RDFa::Parser;
    $parser = RDF::RDFa::Parser->new($xhtml, $baseuri);
   $parser->consume;
  $graph = $parser->graph;


BIGGER THINGS

 * should plug in the HTML5 parser somehow, since majority of in-the-wild files are illformed (poor unicode etc see ekstrabladet.dk test)
 * manifests should declare the testcase file's charset; should parsers also force it, or read from content where available?
 * clarify what we mean by 'triple count' and break out different aspects; eg. triples for core OpenGraphProtocol, triples from 3rd party extensions to it,
   triples from other RDFa vocabularies that happen to be in the same page, and those annoying triples added by RDFa parsers for stylesheet links.
 * ARC is fetching live from Web, not cache; most of our tests point into repo currently so that's ok-ish but needs fixing for external links.
 * full parser has some weirdness reading Japanese, see testCanReadJapaneseUTF8Full unit test.
 * port the various tests that operate on triples, to use the basic common property API instead
 * patch Lite parser to import fb: fields as well as og:, eg. needed for check_nondigit_appid_chars_fail

LITTLE THINGS

 * Extract (and use?) <link rel="canonical" ...>
 * Geo checks; make sure an og:latitude always comes with an og:longitude and vice-versa
 * should document the rules for testcase repository use of relative URIs. See grep -R url */* | grep -v http
 * check for contradictory types (something being a 'restaurant' and a 'profile' simultaneously)
 * FB_NAMESPACE_UNDECLARED not checked for, 'cos we should also check it is being used before complaining.
 * Test: file:testcases/mixi/mixi1.meta is detecting MISSING_REQUIRED_PROPERTY ... our harsh handling of xmlns:og missing; even though it did extract the fields ok.


FAILING TESTS

 * Test: file:testcases/cnn.com/cnn1.meta in sitemap.php checker
   MISSING_REQUIRED_PROPERTY even though two are there it doesn't see og:title or type. This is because we're not falling back on the Lite parser yet.




API

 * Look at the draft W3C RDFa API and consider adoption
 * fix the way we expose the supplied URL (or don't, currently...), whether it's canonicalised
 * APIs for reading from local file and supplied text
 * Charset? can we set it in the parsers?
   e.g. see http://developers.facebook.com/tools/lint/examples/meta_name
 * Agree a canonical form for testing (JSON/triples?)
 * Lite parser (from https://github.com/scottmac/opengraph) not parsing fb: properties (but then ogp.me doesn't mention them)
 * the checker results should be properties of $og; sometimes we find problems in operation not by calling checker (eg. '<' in content)

IMPLEMENTATIONS

 * remove the many parts of ARC library we don't need (MySQL store etc.). Or at least make dependencies clear.
 * patch the bits of ARC2 parser that cause PHP5 to emit warnings?
 * wire in other parser sources
 * Ubuntu ships an earlier phpunit which isn't happy with our setup - investigate

DOCS

Perhaps a flow chart, with HTML, OG markup, FB content, and accuracy as different ways of screwing up.

Share wiki space with other parser / toolkit folk? common testcases?

LINTING

 We want all the bad examples to be detectable, using either the simple parser or an RDFa-based on.

 Reproduce 'meta name' linter check from fb
